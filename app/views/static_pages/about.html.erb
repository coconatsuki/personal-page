          <p>Hello, I'm Amandine and I'm a programmer.</p>
          <p>After studying programming for 1 year through online bootcamps, I'm now looking for a job!</p>
          <p>Before that, I worked as a journalist, a translator and a french teacher for foreign people.</p>
          <p>It's a big change of career but after all, computer programming is just another foreign language!
            Except that you communicate with a much dummier and stubborn individual (that is, your computer).</p>
          <h1 class="header subtitle">So, why becoming a programmer?</h1>
          <p>I began my career in France, spent 3 years in Japan (<a href="www.unefourmiatokyo.com">checkout my blog!</a>), and I'm now living in Montreal.</p>
          <p>Some months after working as a french teacher in Canada, I felt that I wasn't learning and growing anymore.
            It was my 4th year as a teacher when I realized I wanted something new and more challenging.</p>
          <p>I learnt some very basic code during highschool and I remember having fun implementing a couple of games.
          So, when my partner suggested me to learn programming, I felt as if I was going back at my highschool days!</p>
          <p>I quitted my job as a teacher, and began to study through online bootcamps and implementing a lot of projects (practice make perfect!).
          I'm still learning now, while looking for a first professional experience as a web developer.</p>
          <h1 class="header subtitle">When I'm not studying</h1>
          <p>My favorite hobby is probably dancing. I'm currently taking 'Lindy Hop' lessons (on Swing music), and like salsa too.<br />
             I'm also taking some photography classes since january.</p>
          <p>To relax at home, I read a lot (many kinds of books) and play video games.<br />
             I also spend time learning and practicing foreign languages, especially japanese.</p>
          <p>Finally, one of my great pleasures is drinking tea in some 'Salon de th√©' and try out some exotic restaurant!</p>
          <p>Feel free to say hi, if you have some common interests.</p>
          <p>Thank you for reading! </p>
